# jobimarklets [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ndy40/jobimarklets.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ndy40/jobimarklets)

#### Description
A simple Self-hosted Bookmarking service. If you consume a lot of Internet resources, we keep a record of pages we visited or hope to re-visit at a later date. Modern day browsers provide a feature called Bookmarks. Bookmarks stores links to pages or articles you found interesting and you wish to revisit another time. Working with bookmarks on your local machine is the easy part, the trouble comes when you use different machines during the course of your week (Laptop, Desktop, Tablet, Phones).
Keeping your Bookmarks synced and easily accessible across these devices becomes tricky. Also as your bookmark links grows, searching through them also become tricky. So this project is aimed at making the bookmarking experience easy.

#### Objective
The objectives for this project include:
1. Adoption of Best Programming practices - Coding standard, Coding Tools, Continuous Integration, Unit Tests, Git FLow, Docker, Vagrant and some bells and whistles of modern Software Development  
2. To build a service, I actually need and share this need with others who may find them useful. 
3. To have a baby project I am nurturing. 
4. Write code that other developers can review, suggested improvements and also learn from. 
5. To experiment with tools and techniques I may not use in my day to day job for whatever reason.
6. Build a standard product with tests, automatic documentation and process documentation.
7. Have a portfolio of things I have built.
